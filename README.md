# Overlap Analysis

## Overview
This repository focuses on identifying overlaps between efficient cookstove and avoided deforestation projects in voluntary carbon markets. The goal is to assess the risk of double issuance that undermines carbon market integrity.

## Key Features
* **Geospatial Mapping**: Overlay efficient cookstove and avoided deforestation project boundaries
* **Intersection Analysis**: Calculate overlap percentages
* **Visualization**: Generate maps showcasing overlapping regions in Africa, Asia, and Central America under VCS, Gold Standard, and CDM programs

## Project Maps
