# Mapping Carbon Project Overlaps (Geospatial Analysis)

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
This repository focuses on identifying overlaps between efficient cookstove and avoided deforestation projects in voluntary carbon markets. The goal is to assess the risk of double issuance that undermines carbon market integrity.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Carbon credit markets face a critical integrity challenge: when cookstove projects (which reduce fuelwood consumption) and forest protection projects (which prevent deforestation) operate in the same geographic areas, both may claim credit for the same carbon emission reductions. This "double issuance" inflates claimed climate benefits and erodes trust in carbon markets.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Direct Overlap Analysis** â€“ project boundary intersections, % overlap, regional maps  
- **Proximity Analysis** â€“ 5/10/15 km buffers to account for fuelwood collection distances  
- **Case Studies** â€“ detailed district-level analysis of 6 VCS cookstove projects

## Tools and Technologies
* **R**: For geospatial data processing and analysis and  for advanced spatial visualizations
* **QGIS**: To refine and inspect geospatial data
* **Coordinate System**: WGS84 (EPSG:4326)

## Data Preparation
* Download project boundary data from Verra, Gold Standard, or CDM registries
* Preprocess geospatial data using QGIS to generate KML files if needed

## Outputs
* Spatial visualizations saved in the /outputs folder
* CSV files with overlap percentages and statistics
